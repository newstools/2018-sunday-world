Comedian Mpho Popps is so underrated, hopefully he will emerge as the Samas' biggest break-out star after hosting music's biggest night with Somizi and Dineo Ranaka. Brother held it down as the host of the non-broadcast show. What a funnyman, he stole the show and had the audience in stitches. Pity 80% of the winners snubbed the show.

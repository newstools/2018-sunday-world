You know we all have that one friend that never finishes a five minute conversation without saying "my child this or my child that." Well‚ Nyalleng Thibedi has pleaded guilty to being that friend. There are a lot of things that fulfil Thibedi as a person but more than her love for acting and for life in general‚ being called a mommy is her highest calling and she explained why to TshisaLIVE. "I still can't fathom how I gave birth to this incredible human being. I love him unconditionally and receive the same love‚ unconditionally. It's such a consuming yet selfless kind of love." Thibedi has a six-year-old son and she said she often finds herself bragging about the amazing person that has come from her. The actress said it amazed her how she could walk into a shop with the intention of spoiling herself and walk out with bags of clothes and shoes for her son. "Being a mother teaches you to be selfless in a different way. Before you become a mother‚ you may think you selfless but it’s a different level after you give birth to a person. Thibedi explained that when she gets a moment to herself‚ be it in the car or anywhere for that matter‚ she's always thinking about how she can be a better mother and a better person. "I think about I can become a better human being in all facets of my life. Whether it is being a better mother‚ which I never want to stop improving on‚ or being a better actor or how I can connect better with my creator. I always think to myself‚ 'what can I do today that I didn't do yesterday that will help me be better'." Oh woman that's so profound.

Thabiso Molefe is the owner of Twist mobile bar services and event hire. Molefe has been in operation for more than a year. Also a property developer for an oil company by profession, the 31-year-old has quietly been working on building his brand. "The Twist bar specialises in food and cocktails at markets and festivals around the country," said Molefe, whose specialty is a mean gin and tonic. "People are now enjoying the gin taste, and there's now a wide selection of gin and new tonics, which makes gin more palatable for more people." Molefe also sells prego rolls, wings and chips - a simple menu that's proven to be a hit. "The idea was to cater for our clients' needs holistically," he explained. Molefe worked as a bartender in his university days and he develops the cocktails that he serves. He's recently gotten his team to start coming up with new cocktails.

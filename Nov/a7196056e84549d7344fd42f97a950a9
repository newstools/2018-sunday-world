Between June 2015 and May 2016, the department of small business development trained 1037 informal traders, established 29 satellite offices and five centres of business excellence. As long as your business or co-operative meets the criteria, you can access funding or grants through the department or one of its agencies. Bear in mind however, that public sector funding involves a thorough and careful process. SEFA Loans from SEFA can range from as little as R500 up to R3m, with the loans paid directly to owners. This direct payment is important in a business sector that is often not part of traditional banking system.

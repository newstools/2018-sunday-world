This year it is Malwede‚ the falling dance. Thousands of people have taken to their social media accounts to share their version of the dance. Whether it's just a body part falling to the side‚ or a person's whole body dropping‚ it has become a thing. So‚ if you're in a club and you see people falling to the floor‚ don't be alarmed. #KeDezembaBoss Source: TMG Digital.

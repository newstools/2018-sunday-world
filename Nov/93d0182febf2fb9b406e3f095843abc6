Shwa rocked the launch of Honor 8x in SA, which also served as the album launch for rapper Reason's new album Azania. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the music, especially paired with his explosive performance. Shwa was super confused by his black and white school teacher getup. Where was the swag for a dude that's about to welcome twins Hip and Hop with sweetheart LootLove?

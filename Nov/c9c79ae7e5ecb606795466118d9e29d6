The former FC Porto and Blackburn Rovers striker had begun his coaching career as an assistant at Belgian club St Truiden. He completed his Pro Licence course in Scotland. "Cape Town City Football Club is delighted to confirm head coach Benni McCarthy has earned his UEFA Pro Coaching License‚ the highest world-recognised qualification in football‚" the club tweeted on Friday.

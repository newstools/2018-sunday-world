Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba belongs to the moegoe scrapheap for his xenophobic remarks aimed at a man transporting cow heads in a trolley. Mashaba said the cow heads posed a potential risk of an outbreak of ebola, a disease that has hit the DRC recently. It is not the first time he shoots from the hip without considering the consequences. Your apology is late moegoe, the damage has been done.

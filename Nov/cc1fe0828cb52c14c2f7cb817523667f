Shwa also attended the launch of the Lockdown soundtrack. It was such a jam session with Mandla N's prodigy Nelisiwe Sibiya performing live. It felt like an episode of Afro Cafe. Nelisiwe is so adorbs, talented and has a bright future ahead of her. Every time she sings Mama Ka Bafana it's such a tear jerker.

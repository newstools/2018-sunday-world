Lexleo "Dr Smile" Aliwal looked like he was auditioning for Chippendales, eish but dololo muscles. Instead he looked like that cartoon character Sheriff Woody from Toy Story. Who the hell is Dr Smile anyway? He is Mzansi's go-to celebrity dentist and apparently a musician too. Fake it until you make it boo!

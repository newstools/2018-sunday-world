The honeymoon of the relationship between former President Jacob Zuma and his benefactor of many years Zephrona Sizani Dubazana is over. This after Dubazana approached the South Gauteng High Court this week to gain access to the controversial Joburg house that Zuma lived in when he was fired by former president Thabo Mbeki as deputy president in 2005.

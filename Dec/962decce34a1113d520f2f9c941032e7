Shwa met her childhood heroines Leleti Khumalo, aka Sarafina, and Thembi Mtshali-Jones, loved for her role as Thoko in Sgudi 'Snaysi. They were super lovely. Mtshali-Jones was effortlessly chic in electric African print. Both ladies have teamed up in the e.tv telenovela Imbewu: The Seed. Shwa is so happy that Leleti is no longer hiding behind makeup and embracing her vitiligo. She was makeup-free on the night and looked gorgeous. Such a role model.

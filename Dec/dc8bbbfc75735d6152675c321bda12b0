When Shwa met actress Fundiswa Zwane she was expecting a middle-aged conservative church lady with a doek like her character KaMadonsela on Imbewu: The Seed. Bathong, moghel almost looked unrecognisable with her half-shaved head. I was left a little shook. She's super woke, I mean for starters, she was wearing a tee that read "Met God. She's Black". She's super loud and she has tattoos. Shwa's kinda gal. Let's do drinks soon sweetie!

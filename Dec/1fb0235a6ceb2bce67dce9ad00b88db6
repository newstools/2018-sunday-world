Google's 2018 Year in Search reveals that "Black Panther" was the year's most searched-for movie, while the late Spider-Man creator, Stan Lee, features in the top five most-searched for terms of 2018. As the year draws to a close, it's time to take stock of 2018. Google, for one, has released its Year in Search, running down 2018's top-trending queries in several categories. These trends also vary from country to country. "Black Panther" on top Topping the global and American rankings, Ryan Coogler's "Black Panther" movie leads the way as the internet's the most searched for film of 2018. It was a pivotal year for the blockbuster which, as well as grossing over $1 billion worldwide, as also bagged Golden Globe nomination for Best Drama movie. "Deadpool 2" comes second in the list, followed by "Venom," "Avengers: Infinity War," the Freddie Mercury biopic, "Bohemian Rhapsody," Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, "A Star is Born," "Incredibles 2," "The Nun," "A Quiet Place" and "Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom." Netflix dominates As for actors, Sylvester Stallone tops the list of Google's most-searched names worldwide in 2018, followed by Logan Paul, the internet video celebrity who was the center of a controversy at the beginning of the year involving footage of the corpse of a man who had committed suicide in Japan. Actor and comedian Pete Davidson -- who famously stars in "Saturday Night Live" on US TV and was briefly engaged to the singer Ariana Grande -- comes third. When it comes to TV shows, several Netflix series feature in the top 10 most-searched shows on Google, with "Altered Carbon," "The Haunting of Hill House" and "Lost in Space" all in the ranking. In the US, "Roseanne" tops the list of most-searched shows, following the lead actress's racist tweet.

Khelobedu disco artist Khutso Kgale, known as King Monada, is leading the pack at the second annual Limpopo Music Awards (Lima) 2018. The Ska Bhora Moreki hitmaker was nominated in five categories, including for song of the year, best Khelobedu single, best male artist, best video and for best collaboration. Monada's latest hit single Taba Tsaka Ke Tsaka was nominated in two categories. His manager Albert Makwela said they were excited and believed he would take all the awards home. "The recognition and support he's getting from the people is overwhelming," he said. Rising star and Capricorn FM DJ and music manager Hellen Seabi was nominated in two categories, for best female artist and best styled artist, where she would be competing with the likes of Candy Tsa Mandebele. The Afro-soul artist said it was an honour to be nominated because for the longest time women in the music fraternity were overlooked. Lima organiser Fortune "DJ Cappuccino" Maswanganyi said they hope to raise the bar this year. The event is at Meropa Sun Casino in September.

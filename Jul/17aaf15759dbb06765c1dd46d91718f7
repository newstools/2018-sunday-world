Just because it is winter doesn't mean we can't include some great tasting salads. Especially when they are warm. This salad can also be enjoyed on its own as a meal. Warm butternut, farro and spinach salad INGREDIENTS: 1 butternut squash, peeled, seeds removed and diced into cubes 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 spring onion, finely chopped 4 tablespoons olive oil 2 cups farro ( can be replaced with brown rice ) 1 tablespoon butter 1 spring onion, finely diced 3 cups finely shredded spinach 1/4 cup feta cheese Salt and pepper to taste FOR THE DRESSING: 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons unsweetened cranberry juice 1/4 cup olive oil Preheat the oven to 180Â°. Place the butternut on a baking sheet, drizzle with about 2 tablespoons olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss well to evenly coat the squash. Roast in the oven for about 15-20 minutes. Place the farro and about 4-5 cups of cold water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once the farro comes to a boil, lower heat to a simmer, cover, cook for up to 40 minutes till soft. You may substitute farro with brown rice. In a pan, heat remaining oil and butter over medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic. Fry until the onion is translucent. Stir in the spinach, butternut, and farro. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. For the dressing, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, cranberry juice, salt and pepper. While whisking, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Stir the dressing into the warm salad, add the feta and serve warm. Twitter : @thelazymakoti E-mail: Info@thelazymakoti.com

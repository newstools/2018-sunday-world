Celebrity lives are not always glitz and glamour, they are also affected by crime - just ask R&B crooner Langa Mavuso. Like many South Africans, Mavuso fell victim to theft when tsotsis broke into his car and stole his bling items worth R17000, as well as his precious work stored on two hard drives in November last year. The incident happened outside Shine Studio in Braamfontein, Joburg, and he opened a case at the Hillbrow police station. Crime statistics by the South African Police Service show 138172 theft out of motor vehicle cases were opened between April last year and March. Gauteng was the most affected, with Joburg Central, Hillbrow, Sandton and Sunnyside ranked as the worst precincts. In his police statement, Mavuso said he had parked his car with all doors and windows closed and locked as he made his way to the studio. Upon this return, he found the driver's door damaged. But it wasn't until the following day that he discovered that his belongings were stolen from the boot. Among stolen goods were Africa Rising by Black Coffee headphones, items by fashion designer Lukhanyo Mdingi, Nike shoes, a Zara backpack and spectacles. Neo Chabedi, the marketing manager of his recording label Soulistic Music, declined to comment on behalf of the rising star, who is in Europe. "Thank you so much for the interest in Langa Mavuso. Please allow us to pass on the opportunity this time around. Hopefully we can engage soon on other topics," she said. Police spokeswoman Julia Claassen confirmed a case was opened, but had since been closed. "If the property was to be found, then they will reopen the case," she said. "It is very common with theft out of motor vehicle cases but they did take finger prints off the motor vehicle, put it in a file and when someone gets arrested and in case there was a finger print link, then we reopen the case."

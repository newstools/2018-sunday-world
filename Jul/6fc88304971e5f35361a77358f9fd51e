The convicted ANC  ward councillor, Sipho Maselane, is an evil public servant who did not deserve the trust bestowed upon him. The  serial rapist used the same modus operandi when raping and robbing his victims at gunpoint. What takes the cake is that he had a ZCC cap and ANC banners inside his vehicle, his victims testified  in court. Go hang, moegoe.

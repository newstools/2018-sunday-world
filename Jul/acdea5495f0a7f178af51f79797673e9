It's seldom that you find a public relations enterprise that is comfortable with operating from the townships as most prefer the ivory towers and glass buildings of Sandton, and Rosebank. But J Communications, in Pimville, Soweto, founded and owned by former YFM account executive Jabulile Mqoqi, is making its mark in the PR industry. Mqoqi established her PR and marketing agency after realising that budding artists were struggling to get recognition. With five years' experience as accounts manager at three radio stations, Mqoqi, 28, said she conceptualised her start-up two years ago after noticing that there was talent in abundance in the townships although there was no one to bring about professionalism among the young artists. After nine months of operating, Mqoqi signed her first client, Mncedisi Mnguni, popularly known as DJ Big Sky. Among her clients is Keletjile Nyamane, famously known as Kay E, who released a single earlier this month and is receiving airplay on community and commercial radio stations. "I'm passionate about working with artists ... to help them take their careers to another level," she said. Mqoqi said while other agencies preferred to sign established artists rather than groom talent, she cherished putting township talent on the map. As someone who has been in the media space, Mqoqi realised there was a gap in that independent artists struggle to get recognition. "That's where I step in to help artists, especially musicians, get recognised." However, she said the agency is not available to every wannabe artist because some are not willing to work hard and screening is important.

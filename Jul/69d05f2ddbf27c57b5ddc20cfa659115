There was a time when Chippa United star player Andile Mbenyane was a broken man, following the death of his wife in a car crash three years ago. But, today the hard-tackling central midfielder can't hide his excitement at the prospect of walking down the aisle for the second time. Wedding bells are now ringing again for the Paarl-born player after lobola negotiations were set in motion. "Yes, it is true. Even though I didn't want to publicise this, following my tragic loss, I can confirm I am indeed getting married soon. We have been dating for over a year now and I feel it is the right moment for me to move forward," said the 28-year-old player. The woman who stole Mbenyane's heart is Pakama Aba, a Port Elizabeth-based senior assurance associate. The couple met through a mutual friend in PE and Mbenyane said he knew that she was "the one" the moment he laid his eyes on her. Aba, 26, who was with Mbenyane during the telephonic interview, snatched the phone and said: "We went to watch a Chippa game here in PE and he later invited us to his birthday party after the game. We exchanged numbers and throughout the night he kept complimenting me about my beauty. One thing led to another . and here we are." Mbenyane later introduced his girlfriend to his family in Lady Frere in Eastern Cape and said he was ready to move on with his life. "But I took things slowly to see if I am really ready. Now I feel everything is all good and I am happy with her. My late wife's family have given me their blessings and I feel this is the right thing to do. "They are the best buddies with my partner and have assured me of their support." Mbenyane suffered a setback in 2015 when he and his late wife Ahluma Nombulelo Mbenyane were involved in an accident that killed her. The couple was travelling from PE to Cape Town when the accident happened along the scenic Garden Route.

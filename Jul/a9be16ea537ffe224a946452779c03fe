Mamelodi Sundowns need to relook at their transfer policy to avoid losing more of their star players to other clubs for free. The Brazilians have, over the past few years, lost  players after the expiry of their contracts. Currently, the club is in a standoff with striker Percy Tau, who has an offer from English Premiership side Brighton & Hove Albion reported to be in the region of R50-million. Tau has only a year remaining on his  contract and  has refused to pitch for the team's pre-season camp. If the deal is not sealed now with Brighton & Hove Albion or any other club, Sundowns run the risk of losing him for free at the end of the season. The most recent to walk out the door for free is attacker Khama Billiat, who joined rivals Kaizer  Chiefs two weeks  ago. Perhaps the club became a victim of its own success as Billiat left in a huff after his contract expired to seek a new challenge. Billiat is not the first to bolt  once he became a free agent. His new teammate at Chiefs, Ramahlwe Mphahlele, also left Sundowns in 2016 after failing to  agree on a contract extension. The club had invested  so much in developing the defender since he was purchased from Moroka Swallows in 2011. He was sent on loan to AmaTuks before he returned to fulfil his potential as one of the top defenders in the PSL. Sundowns also lost out when midfielder Bongani Zungu moved to Europe to join Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal.

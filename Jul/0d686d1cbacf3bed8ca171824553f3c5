Johannes "Joe" Marumo and Ayanda Ntola met at a work prayer meeting in 2013. Marumo says it was her dedication and love for the faith that drew him to her. "She was doing her internship then. We got along quite well. We shared a lot in common as we were Christians and both were passionate about living a purpose-driven life and impacting the nation through gifts God gave to us. The couple, who are six years apart in age, say before the romance, they became the best of friends. "After a month, we became best friends, best buddies, and we were always there for each other, sharing and motivating one another at all times and watching a few movies together," Marumo says. "A few years later I realised that my best friend is actually the piece I needed to complete my puzzle." So, in August 2015, Marumo decided to declare his love to Ayanda. "She took some time to pray about it and later on came back and said yes. That was the beginning of our love story . In August last year we held the official engagement party in Durban in the presence of both our parents, family and friends." The couple were married in a grand ceremony in Pretoria last year. "We chose La Louise wedding venue, with family and friends coming to witness the beauty of God. "The second day of the wedding was held in Polokwane - Moletjie Ga Semenya - where we officially welcomed Mrs Marumo into my family. The event was blessed by community dancers Dinaka and the best sound by Kgabe Molepo. [Ayanda] is Xhosa so, prior to the wedding, they held a family celebration in Eastern Cape to officially release her." Marriage is even better says Marumo

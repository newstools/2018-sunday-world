Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) board chairwoman and SABC board member Khanyisile Kweyama is recovering from shock and trauma after she was bundled into the boot of her car when she was hijacked on Thursday night. Kweyama was hijacked by two men near her home in Houghton, Joburg, while coming back from an SABC board meeting at Auckland Park. SABC board deputy chairman Mathata Tsedu said a BMW sedan bumped Kweyama's Porsche twice from behind and when she got out to inspect, the hijackers pepper-sprayed her, bundled her into the boot of her car and drove off. Tsedu said the hijackers drove around for three hours before dumping her and the car next to a train station in Katlehong , Ekurhuleni.

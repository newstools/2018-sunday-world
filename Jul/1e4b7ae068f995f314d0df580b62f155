After claiming to be verbally attacked by a stranger in a Wimpy‚ Sizwe Dhlomo channelled his inner-WWE wrestler‚ charged at the man and chest bumped him. Yes fam‚ Dhlomo chest bumped the dude! It all apparently started after Dhlomo decided to grab a bite to eat at the restaurant at a mall in Witbank. Dhlomo said he was listening to music when he noticed a lady waving at him. He thought she had recognised him through his TV work so waved back. "All of a sudden I snap out of it & I see this lady waving at me. I figure okay‚ she must recognise me from somewhere‚ so I wave back. She’s sitting across from some dude‚ so he turns around & looks as who she’s waving at... I carry on eating & bumping some music." The TV personality added that about ten minutes later the dude returned and apparently started shouting at him. That's when he claimed he confronted the guy. That's when he says things got heated. Dhlomo said he realised afterwards how funny the entire incident may have looked.

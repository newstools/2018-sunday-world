Limpopo arts and culture MEC Onicca "MEC Wodumo" Moloi has resigned from her plum job. This, she claims, after she refused to comply with demands, apparently from her principals, who she referred to as "Masana Bishops", to attend late night meetings, choose who to greet, what to write on Facebook, which jamborees to attend and what her political views should be on the forthcoming Peter Mokaba regional conference. But, other allegations are that she resigned after she was booed by delegates at the Limpopo ANC provincial conference last week, where she was defeated by Basikopo Makamu for the party's deputy provincial secretary post. Moloi allegedly complained that Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha, who was elected unopposed to retain his position as the ANC provincial chairperson, didn't protect her from the unruly delegates who jeered her.

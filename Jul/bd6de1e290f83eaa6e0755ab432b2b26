VBS Mutual Bank bosses are moegoes for denying that they mismanaged the institution, leaving thousands of their clients in limbo. Some of them, such as Robert Madzonga, the CEO of the bank's majority shareholding company Vele Investments, have no shame in publicly flaunting their wealth, disregarding the   plight of destitute  clients. What a moegoe!

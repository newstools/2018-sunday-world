Mamelodi Sundowns are on the verge of signing rising star Phakamani Mahlambi. Their capture of Mahlambi from Egyptian giants, Al Ahly, could be exactly what they need to fill the void left by Percy Tau and Khama Billiat. Mahlambi, 20, has not had much game time in north Africa since his switch from Bidvest Wits on a four-year contract last year. But Al Ahly are only keen on a loan deal and not a permanent switch at this stage. Sundowns, meanwhile, are still in hot pursuit of Ajax Cape Town skipper Mosa Lebusa. The left-back is also wanted by giants Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. The Urban Warriors accepted their fate this week and said they are prepared to play in the National First Division (NFD) following a long-running legal saga over striker Tendai Ndoro. The club were penalised by being docked for illegally fielding Ndoro, who was ineligible to play for Ajax after having been contracted to two other clubs in the same season. Lebusa, 25, is just one of a few players who are expected to leave the club and remain in the PSL, including goalkeeper Brendon Petersen, who is now linked with Bidvest Wits. Also moving to Chloorkop, Sundowns' home base, is goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse, who is joining from cross-town rivals SuperSport United. Matsatsantsa are set to welcome back centre-back Bongani Khumalo who left to join English side Tottenham Hotspur a few years ago. Khumalo returned to the country to join Wits, but his stay was short-lived and he is now back at the Tshwane side where he is expected to sign a contract. Bloemfontein Celtic have signed defender Thabo Lingwati from Jomo Cosmos. Promoted newcomers Highlands Park have welcomed 12 new signings including experienced defender Bevan Fransman and many from the NFD. The rest of their signings are: Kyle Peters, Ricardo Williams, Mlungisi Mbunjana, Ivan Mokoena, Ricardo Versuur, Denzil Haoseb, Siphesihle Zwane, Sello Motsepe, Loyd Kazapua, Lesenya Ramoraka and Roberto Fragale.

The no-nonsense National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) South Gauteng has refused to dance to the song of Mdu Masilela's nyatsi as she tries to save him from facing the music for allegedly moering her. Mdu's baby mama Sibahle Dlamini had opened a case of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm against the kwaito godfather at Sandringham police station in Joburg in October last year. This after he allegedly beat her up in a domestic squabble at the musician's Lyndhurst townhouse. Masilela had allegedly gone there to evict Dlamini from the property when the fight broke out. The Chomi ya Bana hitmaker was arrested and released on R5000 bail when he appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court later. Sunday World can reveal that Dlamini asked to withdraw the case when the two appeared in court on July 11. TO READ THE FULL STORY GET A COPY OF TODAY'S SUNDAY WORLD AT YOUR NEAREST STORE

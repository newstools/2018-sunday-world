A senior government official who suffered a mental breakdown was admitted to a psychiatric institution after an online sex video with her lover was leaked on social media. In the video, which has since gone viral on Facebook and Twitter, the married woman could be seen playing with herself while on a video call with her lover. The woman, who is a manager at one of Limpopo's provincial departments, could also be heard talking dirty to her boyfriend and in one instance asked how he would like to have sex with her.

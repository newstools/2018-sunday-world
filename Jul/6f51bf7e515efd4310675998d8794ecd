Hip-hop superstar Nasty C and his former record label Mabala Noise, founded by ANC politician Reggie Nkabinde, are facing a R4.5-million lawsuit for breach of contract. This comes after a company called Freeworld Music, which according to court papers was appointed by Mabala Noise to manage Nasty C's bookings and endorsement deals, filed summons at the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg claiming that it was owed R3.5-million for unpaid services. According to court papers, the company was appointed by Mabala Noise to serve as Nasty C's artist manager and management representative of the label on July 18 2016 following engagements by Nkabinde and company director Zyne Marcus. The two, according to court papers, discussed a need to have an agreement which would lead to a possible business relationship, and Nasty C, whose real name is Nsikayesizwe David Ngcobo, was brought in to discuss terms and clauses which he needed incorporated into the contract.

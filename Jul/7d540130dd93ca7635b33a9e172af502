Political activist and media entrepreneur Shaka Sisulu says he can now breathe a sigh of relief after he successfully sued PR businesswoman Sihle Bolani for R3-million. The South Gauteng High Court ruled in favour of Sisulu and granted a default judgment in his favour. Bolani will also be liable for all costs. Sisulu, the grandson of ANC stalwarts Walter and Albertina, had sued Bolani for R3-million over the ANC war room allegations that surfaced in 2016 ahead of the local government elections. The R50-million war room allegations surfaced in January last year when Bolani sued the ANC for R2.2-million, which she alleges she was supposed to have been paid for her part in the election campaign. Her case, in which she said the war room was set up to discredit opposition parties through a disinformation campaign, was dismissed by the South Gauteng High Court. He said though he was happy about the ruling, he will not use "blood money" to go on a holiday but instead would invest it into a new initiative called #TheDefamationFundZA to support anyone in need of legal support in repairing their reputation. "Every month I will get one person to help clear their names after being defamed on social media to pay for their legal fees and costs of investigations," he said. Bolani said she was not aware of the ruling because she was not even informed about the court date.

Kaizer Chiefs are interested in embattled former Ajax Cape Town striker Tendai Ndoro. The player's representative Gary Cassisa has confirmed his client is being linked to Amakhosi but said  they've not received any offers for Ndoro yet. However, they hope that once Chiefs and SuperSport United have announced their coaches, there's a possibility that either of the clubs would snap up Ndoro. "We have heard  that Chiefs are interested in Tendai but at this stage there's no offer for him from them or any other club," Cassisa told Sunday World. "We just have  to wait and see until Chiefs and SuperSport United appoint coaches. Maybe then there'll be something concrete. We are in talks with three teams but there are no formal offers." Ndoro is a free agent after parting ways with Ajax Cape Town last month. The Zimbabwean striker has been dominating headlines since joining Ajax from Saudi Arabian club Al-Faisaly last December.  He's the focal point of the ongoing PSL chaos that has seen Ajax being  restored to the 15th spot on the log after a court order while the league is challenging the  ruling . "He enjoyed his time at Ajax but with all this situation it was a mutual decision that he leaves the club. The environment was no longer good for him. He's training by himself, and he looks sharp," Cassisa said. "Any team that finds him now, he's going to score them goals. Ndoro is   a natural goal scorer. He's in good mental state as well."

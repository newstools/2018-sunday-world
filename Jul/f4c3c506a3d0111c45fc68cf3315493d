Former PSL Footballer of the Season Lebogang Manyama could become the latest footballer to return to SA after enduring a torrid spell overseas. It seems the grass is not always greener on the other side, with players coming back to the PSL in their numbers. Bafana Bafana midfielder Andile Jali recently joined Mamelodi Sundowns after a stint in Belgium. Manyama is considering his options at Turkish club Konyaspor after a single season since joining them from Cape Town City. His move to Turkey came with high expectations as the club handed him the coveted number 10 jersey. His agent Maimane Phiri says it will be up to Manyama to decide his next move. "I have had a discussion with him and he has told me about not playing as much as he wanted to in Turkey," Phiri said. Manyama has only made a few appearances at the club. "At the end of the day I can't force him to stay there so he must decide what is best for his future. I have given him my advice that he must hang in there and stay overseas." The 27-year-old has reportedly told Konyaspor coach Riza Calimbay to let him go if he does not want to use him. Phiri was coy about his client's next move. "I can't talk much, but a few clubs have made inquiries."

Justice minister Michael Masutha suffered a health scare yesterday when he was hospitalised after he collapsed at the funeral of ANC veteran and Limpopo Agriculture MEC Joyce Mashamba. According to Masutha's spokesman, Mukoni Ratshitanga, the incident happened at the late Mashamba's home in Malamulele in Giyani, Limpopo. Ratshitanga also revealed that it was not the first time that the partially blind minister faced a similar health scare, as it had also happened last year. "He collapsed while at a funeral and was rushed to Malamulele Hospital, where he was stabilised and treated. "He was then airlifted to Pretoria for further treatment, but I don't have the name of the hospital at the moment. "I have no idea what caused him to collapse. I was not there with him," Ratshitanga said.

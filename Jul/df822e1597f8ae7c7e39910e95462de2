Maritzburg United are believed to have earmarked SuperSport United outcast Tefu Mashamaite as a perfect replacement for their departed skipper Bevan Fransman, who recently left for the newly promoted Highlands Park. Upon his return to SA from his one year stint with Swedish outfit Hacken in 2016, Mashamaite, 33, penned a two-year deal with SuperSport but at the end of the past season the Tshwane-based club decided against prolonging his stay. A source close to Maritzburg told Sunday World that the KwaZulu-Natal-based side is monitoring Mashamaite's situation, saying that coach Fadlu Davids deems the experienced defender as the suitable replacement for Fransman. "I can tell you that Maritzburg want to sign an experienced defender and Fadlu is interested in Mashamaite," said our informant who is close to the club. "Last season Fransman was very solid and now they want someone who will plug the gap he left." Attempts to get comment from Davids and Mashamaite drew a blank as they were both not picking up their phones. But Maritzburg chairman Farook Kadodia emphasised that they were not interested in Mashamaite. "We don't get involved in speculations. For the record, there's no interest in Mashamaite, chances of us signing him are absolutely zero," Kadodia said. Last month the Team of Choice confirmed that defender Siyanda Xulu will inherit the captain's arm band. Mashamaite struggled for game time at SuperSport. He only made 10 appearances over the two seasons he stayed at the club.

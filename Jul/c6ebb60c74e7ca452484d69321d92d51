Leftovers from the regular seven-colours Sunday lunch are a bother and I hate throwing food away. I decided to come up with quick and easy ways to repurpose this food for the week's dinners or to pack in your lunch box. Leftover butternut mash to make butternut bread Servings: Makes two loaves. Cooking Time: 1 Hour Preheat the oven to 180 degrees and grease 2 loaf tins. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. Whisk until well combined; set aside. In a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition until light and fluffy. Then beat in the pumpkin. Add the flour and mix on low speed until combined. Turn the batter into the prepared pans, dividing evenly, and bake for an hour, or until tooth pick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool and serve with butter or margarine. Leftover stew pies. Serves 4 Baking Time 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees. Place your ramekins top-down on the pastry, and cut around it with a sharp knife. Repeat for the remaining ramekins. Divide the cold stew evenly between the 4 ramekins.Press the pastry circles onto the edge of the ramekins or tuck the pastry in around the edge of the ramekins. Brush the pastry with milk. Cut a small incision in the middle of each pie with a sharp knife. Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown and well risen. The pie filling may start to bubble out of the cut in the pastry, or around the edges, indicating that the filling is hot. Cool for 5-10 minutes before serving. *You can contact The Lazy Makoti oninfo@thelazymakoti.com or follow on Twitter @thelazymakoti

You can do a lot of things online but‚ lesson for the week‚ don't come for Thandiswa Mazwai or use her to bash women. One Twitter user got that lesson for free when he took to social media to claim that there was a lack of female singers willing to lift the nation. The only singer he had praise for was Mazwai and urged her not to let "greed into her heart". He later said he regretted the post‚ but the thing about Mazwai is that she's always watching. Mazwai responded by telling the user not to use her in his criticism of women. "I would rather you didn’t use me to bash other women‚" she wrote. Mazwai then questioned why he did not hold men to the same standard. "Shouldn’t they also be making music to uplift the masses? Shouldn’t you also be looking at your own self and what gifts you have that you could use to uplift people?" she asked. The singer ended her lecture by claiming that while the tweep was critical of women's nakedness‚ going naked could actually be "a revolutionary act". "Nakedness can be a revolutionary act for women in a world that says cover up or get raped."

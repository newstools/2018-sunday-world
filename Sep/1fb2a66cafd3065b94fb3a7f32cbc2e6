The manner in which Highlands Park captain Tapuwa Kapini ventured into the vehicle repair business is a true example of  the old adage "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade". Kapini co-owns a workshop that fixes gearboxes in Pomona, Kempton Park.  The Highlands skipper had no intention of getting  into fixing   gearboxes until his own Ford Ranger ruptured a gearbox some years ago. His attempts to fix it hit a snag when the dealership slapped him with a R46000 quotation, without knowing  they were planting the seed for a  business  in the Zimbabwean shot-stopper's mind. Kapini  took  matters into  his own hands. "My  Ford Ranger had a had gearbox  problem, when I took it to a Ford dealership they   quoted me R46000 to install a new one," he recalled. "I could not afford that amount. "I went to a friend of mine who had  little knowledge of fixing cars. We took the gearbox out, thoroughly  cleaned and examined  it and put in some screws. That's how I got into this business. Today, we co-own   Trec Gearbox Specialist  business, and it is  registered." The ex-Platinum Stars and AmaZulu keeper  is planning to enhance his  mechanic  expertise by obtaining an analogous certificate in the near future. "We have four employees. Most of the time I am in camp with the team and that's when my partner Emmanuel steps   up and does everything. We fix approximately five cars a day, depending on the parts [available]. If it's cars like Toyotas, it's easy," Kapini stated. The Lions of the North captain arrived in SA in 2007. He's fluent in Zulu and Setswana. The  34-year-old goalie is not planning to retire any time soon. He spends his leisure time with his children.

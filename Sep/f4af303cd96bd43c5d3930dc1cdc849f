SA showbiz's top banana, Bonang Matheba will on Thursday step into the witness box at the Johannesburg Specialised Commercialised Crimes Court to face charges of fraud. This after the police's elite unit, the Hawks, charged the likeable model and TV presenter with fraud relating to her personal and business tax. Another top entertainer, Rapulana Seiphemo, who plays Tau in Generations: The legacy, will appear in the same court a day before Matheba on similar charges.

"Both of them are charged with contravening S234(d) of the TAA [Tax Administration Act, for failure to submit income tax returns as and when required]."

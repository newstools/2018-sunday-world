EFF leader Julius Malema has filed a defamation lawsuit against the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) and its secretary-general Njabulo Nzuza over bribery claims. Malema, the former ANCYL president, is demanding a whopping R1m and for his political rival to withdraw the "defamatory" statements he made during an interview with suspended Power FM talk show host JJ Tabane on August 21.

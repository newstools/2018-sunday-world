Kaya FM has been rocked by an embarrassing scandal of sexual harassment and xenophobia involving a then foreign national employee and his colleagues. Nkosinathi Tshuma, pictured, who was fired from his position as the station's branding specialist, has accused a male colleague of sexual harassment after he allegedly told him to bend over so he could bonk him from behind. The Zimbabwean-born Tshuma has also accused another female colleague of xenophobia after he alleged she spat numerous times in his presence and complained that his bums had a foul smell. The shocking allegations are contained in Labour Court documents Tshuma filed against Kaya FM to challenge his dismissal. The matter is to be heard on a date still to be decided.

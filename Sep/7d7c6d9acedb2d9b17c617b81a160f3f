The wife of well-known soapie star has revealed explosive details of their failed marriage, claiming the "abusive and erratic" star cheated on her with both men and women. Gloves are off between the couple as the TV star's wife reveals in an affidavit unsavoury shenanigans in their marriage, including allegations of his past as a drug dealer and fugitive of justice. The couple, who are estranged, cannot be named as they share two minor children and are in the process of a divorce. They are fighting for custody of their two daughters and the wife deposed the affidavit to seek full custody of the kids. She said the man has been the greatest stumbling block to their divorce being finalised by ignoring any letters from her lawyers. In her affidavit, she said in 2016 before they started divorce proceedings, the actor had a threesome with two women in his hotel room in Durban. "He had and still has multiple affairs. He is still sending explicit pictures to other women and posts nudes, sexual stimulants and promotes sex on a regular basis on social media."

Outgoing Free State premier Ace Magashule’s lavish bash has received a major backlash from Twitter users. The Free State government reportedly threw a farewell party for Magashule at the Free State rugby stadium at a cost of R20 million. The Twitterati trolled Magashule and even took a swipe at the food served to members of the public in attendance‚ which included a breakfast of two bread rolls and a drumstick.

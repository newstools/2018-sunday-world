The second coming of moegoe Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has been full of drama. His  time as  minister is ticking  after he lied  about the citizenship status of the Guptas. He contradicted himself, saying the Guptas are  SA citizens, then made a U-turn and said they are not. Like his friends from the Jacob Zuma era, the moegoe belongs to the political scrapheap.

Our golden girl Caster Semenya lit up the Grand Prix Series athletics meeting in Pretoria when the 800m world and Olympic  champ smashed  Ilse Wicksel's 35-year-old apartheid sport 1000m SA record. Not to be outdone in academic stakes, Semenya  also graduated with a diploma in sports science from the  North West University. Our champ has brains to match her athleticism. Good for you, charmza.

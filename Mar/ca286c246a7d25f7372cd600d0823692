EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu's  shenanigans outside parliament  have gifted him the honour of moegoe of the week. In full view of the public and other journalists, Shivambu is seen in a video, which has since gone viral, going for the neck of a journalist, seemingly desperate to throttle him. Wear the moegoe crown with pride, Floyd.

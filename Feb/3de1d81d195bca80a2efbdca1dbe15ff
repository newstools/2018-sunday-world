The thugs who killed policemen and a soldier in Engcobo, Eastern Cape, are this week's moegoes. The latest is that seven people have been  killed and several taken in for questioning. But who, in their right mind, would brazenly enter a police station, randomly fire at police and steal service pistols? They are the dumbest tsotsis, who can run, but can't hide.

When President Cyril Ramaphosa quoted Hugh Masekela's song‚ Thuma Mina (Send Me) in his maiden state of the nation address‚ the clip went viral and was considered by many as a unifier among South Africans. And it seems Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba attempted the same‚ only he quoted Kendrick Lamar‚ and Twitter had a field day. Gigaba was giving his first budget speech and said: "As urban poet Kendrick Lamar says: 'We gon' be right‚ we gon' be alright.'" Twitter was quick to point out that in the song Alright by the American rapper‚ the line is actually 'N***a we gon' be alright‚ n***a we gon' be alright.' And then the memes started rolling in. They were never ready.

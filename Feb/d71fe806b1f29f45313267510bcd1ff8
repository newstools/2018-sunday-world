National police commissioner Khehla Sitole charmed us all this week when he showed determination to wrestle with and fight crime head-on. The charmza top cop unveiled a "turnaround strategy" for the police, using "unconventional" methods to nail criminals. We welcome any law enforcement strategy that will make us feel safe. Go for it, charmza. After so much bungling, we're right behind you.

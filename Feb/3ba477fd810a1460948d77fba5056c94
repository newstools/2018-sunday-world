ANC Joburg branch secretary Thabiso Setona receives our crown of moegoe of the week for kicking a woman  while she was down, during a protest  outside Luthuli House. Acting like a raging bull,  the burly Setona could not hold back   even when he was being begged for mercy. You couldn't find no better moegoe, that Wathint'abafazi Wathinta Imbokodo.

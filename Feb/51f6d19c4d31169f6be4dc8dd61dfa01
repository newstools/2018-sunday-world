While Mzansi may have finally gotten over the famous Boity Thulo and Cassper split‚ Thulo is ready to move on‚ but only if the guy can keep up with her financially. She told Touch HD's Rorisang Thandekiso that she needed a man who could look after her. "Do you think I'd get married to a broke man‚" Thulo asked Rori‚ who also agreed that it wasn't an option. "I am done with men who are broke. I don't even care what anybody says about it. What do you think must happen if you don't have money? No man‚ I work really hard and I am not willing to step into a marriage where I have everything and you have nothing." While Thulo was vague on whether she'd already found this man‚ she went on to entertain a conversations about weddings. The pair were talking hypothetical weddings when Thulo said she might have a destination wedding in a place like Bora Bora‚ which raised the question of who would pay for it. That's when the presenter explained that her man needed to be able to make that happen for their families. Thulo said that there was a time where wealth was not a factor but that has changed and she was not willing to be the only one holding the purse strings. "I think we've been through that stage where you are like 'Ag‚ it doesn't matter. It's fine. I love him.' But not anymore. Now it's like 'you need to level up' or at least be at a certain level‚" Thulo said.

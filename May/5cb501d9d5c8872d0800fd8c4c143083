AfriForum leader Kallie Kriel is continuing to subject the people of this country to the past, harsh realities of apartheid. This week Kriel was adamant that apartheid was not a  crime against humanity. Phew! The moegoe's sentiments show his lack of compassion for all those who suffered under apartheid. His utterances smack of being  that of an ultra-racist belonging to a white supremacist party. Sies.

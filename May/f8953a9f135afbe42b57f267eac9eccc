One of my fondest childhood memories  is  waking up to the smell of my mother’s baking, that amazing smell that would fill the entire house and bring a smile on all our faces. To this day, that aroma conjures up nostalgia and joy wherever I smell it. Almost all my favourite memories are attached to my mom’s food. Try these for mom for a perfect Mother’s Day lunch this Sunday. 1 kg lamb knuckles, cubed 1 onion, chopped 2 teaspoons hot curry powder 1 teaspoon turmeric 2 teaspoons garlic, minced 1 beef oxtail cube 2 carrots, peeled and sliced 6-8 baby potatoes, halved 1 tablespoon apricot jam 2 tablespoons coriander, chopped Season the meat with salt and pepper.

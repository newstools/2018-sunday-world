Y'all remember when Drake went and melted our hearts with his love declaration for Rihanna at the VMAs when he presented her with the Vanguard award? As it turned out‚ sis wasn't feeling the extra attention and has revealed it was the most "uncomfortable" moment at the ceremony. We were all totes jelly over the chemistry Rihanna and Drake shared in that Work music video and how they were all cute and stuff. We invested our data (which means a lot because data in Mzansi is expensive AF)‚ emojis and actual emotions only for them to break up and leave us hanging. Anyway‚ it was a while back and we should be over it by now and just appreciate the music they left us. However‚ Rihanna's recent revelation that the pair aren't even friends left us in our feels again. The hitmaker revealed in a profile on Vogue‚ which she covers for June 2018‚ that she and her ex beau were not on the greatest terms at the moment. The pair were romantically linked round about the time they collaborated on Work. "We don’t have a friendship now‚ but we’re not enemies either. It is what it is‚'" Rihanna told the magazine when asked about the current state of relationship with Drake. Yikes. But clearly sis is totes over it because‚ uhm‚ she's happy and glowing‚ and all that! Oh and she's working on a reggae album. Just watch her in this video:

This Sunday I wanted to share another popular African dish; Jollof rice. A favourite in Nigeria, Senegal and Ghana - in fact, all of west Africa - this rice dish is cooked in a tomato sauce and can be served with chicken, other meats or fish. The jury is still out on which of these countries make the best tasting version of this dish, many heated arguments haveensued over what has been dubbed "The jollof wars", but I think we can all agree that they each taste great. I tried another rice dish that is fast becoming popular; poke bowl. Poke (pronounced poh-kay) is the new dish that is as tasty as it is visually appealing, plus packed with healthy, raw ingredients. Packed with lots of colourful vegetable and fruit, it's easy to see why it has become a firm favourite with instagrammers. There are also "Poke bars" - restaurants dedicated to this aesthetically pleasing dish, like the Hokey Poke in Cape Town. The structure is usually raw, cubed fish such as salmon and a variety of fruit and vegetable served on a bed of sushi rice or noodles. Picture the combination of the pink of salmon, the yellow of pineapple, the white of rice, the green of span peas, the orange of carrots and the purple of red cabbage. The poke bowl is often considered "the next generation of sushi," because of its popularity and similarity of ingredients such as soy sauce, sesame seeds, sushi rice and salmon. Soon you will be seeing this rice dish pop up on menus at good restaurants everywhere.

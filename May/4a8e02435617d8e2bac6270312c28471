Convicted woman beater and former deputy minister of higher education Mduduzi Manana has taken his moegoe status to another level after allegations that he physically and emotionally abused his helper. His interpersonal relations with women render Manana an abuser of note. Adding insult to injury is that Christine Wiro claims the ANC MP wanted to offer her a bribe to drop the case she opened. What  a  moegoe.

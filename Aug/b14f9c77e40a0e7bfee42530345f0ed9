Staying healthy through the long winter months has been a challenge, but we are almost at the finish line. Luckily, there are foods that can help you stay strong and keep colds away, and are easy to incorporate into your favourite meals. One favourite is citrus. I wanted to show you how great citrus is as an addition to the beloved green salad. Mixed garden salad with fruit Prep time: 10 minutes Serves 6-8 To make the salad, place the lettuce in a large serving bowl. Top with fruit, cheese and nuts. To make the dressing, add all ingredients to a mason jar or container with a tight fitting lid. Shake to combine until the honey is dissolved and the dressing is well mixed. Pour the dressing over the salad. Toss to combine and serve immediately. Exotic fruits are taking centre stage, largely influenced by the growing trend of consumers adopting healthier plant-based diets. "New fruit" to look out for includes the dragon fruit: the texture of the flesh is very much like the juicy flesh of kiwi fruit, with similar tiny, edible black seeds inside. It tastes a bit like a mix of pear, kiwi fruit and watermelon. *You can reach The Lazy Makoti by following her on social media: Twitter and Instagram: @thelazymakoti

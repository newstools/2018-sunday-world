It's finally getting warmer as we ease ourselves past winter and into spring. A reminder that summer is coming and will require accompanying summer bodies, beach and bum shorts. So now is as good a time as any to not only start working out but most importantly, to start eating better. It's not all salad and gloom, there are plenty of ways to eat better without having to starve. Serves: 4 Preparation time: 20min Ingredients: 8 small baby marrows, ends trimmed 2 cups packed fresh basil leaves 2 cloves garlic 1/3 cup olive oil 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 1/4 cup pine nuts Salt and pepper, to taste Cherry tomatoes Use a julienne peeler or mandoline to slice the baby marrow into noodles. Blanch by cooking in boiling water for 3 minutes then dropping in icy cold water (this stops the cooking process and retains the green colour ) . Drain water and put aside. Combine the basil, pine nuts and garlic in a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. Slowly add the olive oil in a constant stream while the food processor is on. Stop the machine and scrape down the sides of the food processor with a rubber spatula. Add the lemon juice and Parmesan cheese. Pulse until blended. Season with salt and pepper. Combine the baby marrow pasta and pesto. Toss until baby marrow pasta is well coated. Top with tomatoes and serve. Everyone loves a great tasty bowl of pasta, problem is, it's probably not the best thing to have if you are watching your weight. But not to worry, there's an amazing substitute for this favourite: vegetable pasta. You can now turn your favourite veggies into delicious pasta. Butternut, baby marrow, beetroot and carrots work best. They provide the real satisfaction of a plate of noodles, while being the much healthier option. These veggies can be baked, boiled or roasted to create all kinds of dishes. You can reach The Lazy Makoti on email info@thelazymakoti.com or by following her on Instagram @thelazymakoti

Former Orlando Pirates defender Ayanda Gcaba has been dragged into a love triangle scandal after two women fought over him at a nightclub in Sandton. The two apparently fought outside Taboo Night Club over the soccer player a few weeks ago. The break-up of their friendship included leaking nude pics of aspirant model Lerato "Habiba" Makgatho, who is known for seeking fame by appearing in TV reality shows. The images, leaked on Monday on Twitter, show the naked Makgatho in a bathtub and three more graphic images on her bed with legs wide open showing her genitals and breasts. Makgatho says she suspects the nudes were leaked by her spiteful former best friend with the aim to tarnish her reputation. "I think the posts were leaked by my friend, Ayanda Gcaba's girlfriend, I think she exposed my nudes because she realised that Ayanda is into me," Makgatho claimed.

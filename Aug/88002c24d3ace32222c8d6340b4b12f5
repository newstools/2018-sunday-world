Women's Month kicked off with a bang on Wednesday with countrywide marches and pickets over violence against women, children and gender non-conforming people. Dubbed #TheTotalShutdown, the marches saw thousands of women from all walks of life protesting against gender-based violence. To all who came to voice their abhorrence, you are charmzas. Bravo, for even getting the audience of President Cyril Ramaphosa.

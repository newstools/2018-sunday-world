From Thamsanqa Sangweni and Musa Nyatama to recently acquired Abel Mabaso and Kudakwashe Mahachi, Orlando Pirates have faith in Mamelodi Sundowns outcasts, but only time will tell if they are worth the faith showed in them. The Buccaneers' gamble to give soccer lifelines to players who have not lived up to expectations at bigger clubs - Sundowns in this case - has not always yielded the desired outcome. Sangweni didn't make the grade, failing to shine at Sundowns but redeemed himself at Chippa United, prompting Bucs to buy him, but again he found the going tough at the Sea Robbers. Nyatama struggled at the Brazilians, his second chance at a big team, but the scenario changed at Pirates - a move that proved to be a masterstroke - after winning the club's Player of the Year gong among his other accolades at Bucs awards last month. Mahachi on the other hand is so determined to buck Sangweni's trend of failing twice after first playing in the Absa Premiership in 2014 following his move to Sundowns from Highlanders FC of his Bulawayo hometown. Explaining why he flopped at the Brazilians before moving to Golden Arrows, Mahachi said: "I was still very young at Sundowns. I joined them straight from [Highlands FC in Zimbabwe]. I was naive and did not understand the local football culture. At Sundowns I found top players, experienced guys like Surprise Moriri, eish... It was not easy." The 24-year-old added: "I've matured now after three years at Arrows. I want to do well for Pirates. I've grown and I'm determined to help Pirates reach greater heights. "I need to continue from where I left off last season and work even harder because we've got great coaches such as [Milutin Sredojevic] Micho and Rulani [Mokwena], who always want us to show determination to do our best."

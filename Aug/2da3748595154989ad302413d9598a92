Listeners of Thobela FM and lovers of two drive shows Ditla Le Meso and Ntshirogele recently woke up to new voices. In an unexpected move this week, the station recalled the afternoon drive show co-hosts Sebasa "The Supa Dupa" Mogale and Mankoko "Baby" Mkhari from the popular Ntshirogele show. The pair was moved to co-host the morning drive show Ditla Le Meso which used to be co-presented by Kgopotso Mashego and Mathumo Manaka. Mashego and Manaka have moved to the graveyard slot, Naledi Ya Meso, which was presented by Setswatswa Sa Kgasho's Nkgadimeng Kekana. The award-winning Kekana is now co-hosting Ntshirogele with Thabo Mohlatlole, popularly known as Thabo Wa MoAfrika. The changes were applauded on social media platforms where the presenters got a warm reception from their followers welcoming them. Listening to the show this week, the vibrant Ditla Le Meso pair is doing great. The two also posted a video on Twitter, showing how happy they are in the new slot. Sunday World was anonymously told that the second reshuffle this year was necessitated by the dwindling listenership on the two shows. The source further alluded there were grievances that Manaka never auditioned for the position. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago dismissed the allegations and said the seasonal move was standard procedure. He said that not all presenters had to be auditioned and that Manaka was a radio legend who has worked at various radio stations. "We only auditioned for new voices." In a statement from the SABC, station manager Mosh Matsena said like all other stations Thobela FM continued to review its business and line-up to ensure it delivers on its mandate and remains relevant.

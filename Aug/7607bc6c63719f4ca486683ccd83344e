Following his passing, speculation was rife that Prokid's death could have been due to drug overdose. But on Wednesday the family released a statement to set the record straight. They said the preliminary post-mortem results have revealed that the rapper died due to bleeding in the gastro-intestinal tract. The family said the muso suffered from hemosuccus pancreaticus - “bleeding in the pancreas, pancreatic duct, or structures near the pancreas such as the splenic artery that bleed into the pancreatic duct”. Prokid, 37, real name Linda Mkhize, died last Wednesday at the apartment of Mandisa whom he had been dating since last year behind his wife Ayanda’s back. The Dankie San hitmaker took his last breath at his girlfriend's flat after complaining of stomach pains for a week. Mandisa shared Prokid's last moments before his demise and how the rapper died in her arms after he had a seizure. She had tried and failed to resuscitate him. The paramedics called on the scene declared the rapper dead at 8pm last Wednesday. On Monday, Prokid's family descended on the flat of his girlfriend to “collect his spirit”. Sunday World has learnt that they went to the flat in Licence Hall in the Joburg CBD accompanied by a traditional healer. The spokesperson for the family, Phumla Nohashe, confirmed the performance of rituals at the flat. "Ukulanda umoya [fetching the deceased spirit] is a known African [Zulu] custom practice. Each family [clan] follows its own custom, the Mkhize and Vilakazi family did right by their beloved son. We ask again that we be given the space to mourn one of our own without media scrutiny," said Nohashe. Vilakazi is the surname of Prokid’s mother. The rapper will be buried at West Park Cemetery’s Heroes Acre on Sunday.

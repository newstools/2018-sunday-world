If they had their way, Absa Premiership clubs would prefer to sell their best players in momey-spinning deals with European clubs. Cape Town City, only in their third PSL season, have also found the international market tough to crack, succumbing to selling their best players locally in the last couple of months. In a move that surprised the local football fraternity, City sold Aubrey Ngoma and Lyle Lakay to Mamelodi Sundowns. This, interestingly, comes after they reneged on their previous declaration that those lads were "not for sale". Shortly after the side was established in 2016, the Citizens' boss John Comitis made it known that he was not willing to sell his "best players" locally, especially to Sundowns. But last December changed when he traded Ngoma to the Brazilians. Speaking to Sunday World this week, Comitis unexpectedly responded by saying "it's always great to do business with Sundowns". "I cannot reveal how much we got from Sundowns for Lakay. We hope the boy will shine there and even make us regret why we let him go," said Comitis. The City boss also emphasised that he didn't sell his left-winger to the Brazilians because of [an] irresistible offer, insisting he sold Lakay because he had bought Gift Links and Riyaad Norodien who play similarly as Lakay. "The deal was not motivated by money. We didn't sell Lakay because we wanted money; it was because we had bought players we believe in [more] in his position. We are excited to have Gift Links and Norodien." Comitis said his current squad is the best ever since he got involved in football. He is positive the current City players are capable to challenge for top honours. "In my 15 years of being involved in football, I haven't seen a strong team like this. "We have all it takes to challenge for trophies. I trust this team, but we've put no pressure on them."

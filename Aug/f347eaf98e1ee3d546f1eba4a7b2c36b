It's official! TV personality Boity Thulo is here to kill the rap game with her "Bad B" musical alter ego‚ and her debut single is serving flame after flame. Boity has been teasing a career in music ever since she met up with Nasty C on Club 808 over a year ago. After that show‚ Nasty C invited her to studio to work on some music and the pair immediately started working on some dope tracks.

You know‚ in case yáll want to stick the lyrics up as your WhatsApp status. "Black woman‚ white man money‚ getting back the land" Translation: she's getting those coins! "Looks like there's a demon in my shoes." She is not here to play‚ guys. "That boy's as ugly as my past" Some times you just need to swerve. "You selling your soul for some Louis‚ and half of your crew is some rats" That Louis V life is not easy‚ mchana. "Turning foreigners to citizen because in my garage is immigrants" Who wants a ride?

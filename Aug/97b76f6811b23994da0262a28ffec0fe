Skeem Saam actress Shoki Sebotsane was strangled twice, punched several times in the face and in the body by her husband Sello Sebotsane in two separate incidents of domestic violence that occurred at their Kibler Park home, south of Joburg. He apparently attacked her after accusing her of depriving him of his conjugal rights. The former Muvhango actress sustained injuries to her face, stomach and legs after the assault that occurred in front of their sick child. After the fracas, Shoki obtained a protection order against her husband and later opened a case of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm at the Mondeor police station. The two faced each other at the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court this week after the incident that happened in 2016 as Sebotsane faced a charge of assault.

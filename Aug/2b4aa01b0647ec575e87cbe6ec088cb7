There could be a last-ditch effort to save Bloemfontein Celtic from its financial troubles, Sunday World has learnt. Celtic are struggling to keep themselves afloat and have for months struggled to honour payments to their players. It is also uncertain whether the players will honour their opening league fixture against Chippa United at the Dr Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein today. Things have gone from bad to worse with revelations that the club could be liquidated next month after financial institution Standard Bank filed a high court application for a provisional liquidation of the club. A number of Celtic players have confirmed that they were still waiting for their salaries that were due on July 28. At the time of writing, they hadn't been paid. "We were supposed to get our salaries on the 28th, but we all got nothing. We don't know what's next," said one player speaking on condition of anonymity. Last month, the players were on strike after six players were allegedly not paid their salaries and, in solidarity with their teammates, the rest of the team decided not to go to work. It took the intervention of SA Football Players' Union to resolve the matter during a meeting in Bloemfontein. Before that, players had absconded from training. Sunday World has it on good authority that there are new interested buyers who could rescue Celtic. "There's a businesswoman called Rosemary "Sinki" Leshabane and together with some partners they may buy the club," a source said. According to information available to us Leshabane owns ABC Motsepe League side Mangaung United. Efforts to get comment from all the parties were unsuccessful.

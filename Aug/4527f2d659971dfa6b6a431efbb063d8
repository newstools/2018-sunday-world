Less than a month into the job, Kaizer Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas has already experienced just how impatient Amakhosi fans can be. Already, he has been jeered by a section of Amakhosi supporters venting out frustration over the lack of positive results in the first two league matches. In his second game in charge, against Bidvest Wits, the supporters heckled Solinas - forcing him to make substitutions as they lost 3-1 in his first home encounter at the FNB Stadium. The Italian, who was appointed on July 13, already seems to understand how hard the fans are to please. "Guys, this is football. If I put A they want B, and if I put in B then they want A," an exasperated Solinas said about the jeering. Pundits have questioned Chief's poor activity in the transfer market having signed only Khama Billiat, Letlhogonolo Mirwa, keeper Virgil Vries and Madagascan Adriamirado "Dax" Andrianarimanana. In an attempt not to ruffle any feathers, Solinas was coy about whether he wanted the club to sign more players. "I don't want to speak about signings; the market I can only speak about [is] the player that I have in my squad. "If I speak about the market it means I don't respect my players," he insisted. "Dax the midfielder from Madagascar is still coming and we awaiting his registration. I am happy with my players; I don't complain about them because I believe in them." With games coming thick and fast, it will take the 50-year-old tactician some time to implement his philosophy. "In football you need time. Now we play every two or three days, we don't have the time for training we only have time for recovery. "Chiefs is a big club that need to compete for trophies. We need time to implement the philosophy and to improve." On Tuesday, Chiefs travel to Baroka for a PSL fixture.

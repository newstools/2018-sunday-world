Since moving to Mzansi from the UK in 2015, SuperSport United captain Dean Furman has been enjoying the local lifestyle and ways of doing things. But the gangly midfielder is kicking himself for having failed to grasp even a single of the country's indigenous languages in the past three years. "I am very upset with myself that I don't speak any local language. This year I have planned to learn one of them just to communicate better with the boys [referring to his teammates]," Furman said. "Most of the boys speak [isiZulu] and maybe that would be the one to go for. Yeye [Reneilwe Letsholonyane] and Thuso Phala will have to help me here and there. I am eager to be able to speak at least one local language." During off-season Furman, 30, tied the knot with his longtime sweetheart Natasha, whom he met in Manchester through a family friend. The Bafana Bafana skipper feels getting married has helped him become more grounded. "We married in the recent soccer season break. It was a beautiful wedding. Getting married has helped me to be even more responsible, not party too much. It sets a good example because we are also role models as footballers," he said. The Bafana midfield enforcer said he loves the South African lifestyle. His family left this country when he was five years old to settle in England. "We are happy to be back in our country. My wife is also enjoying the lifestyle this side. One of the things I like about SA is music, I listen to local House music, especially in the dressing room with the boys. I also enjoy pap, the braai... hahaha," he said, chuckling. Furman wishes to live in the country as long as he can. Some of his cousins and uncles, among his relatives, stay in the Mother City and Joburg.

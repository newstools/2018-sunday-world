VBS Mutual Bank CEO Andile Ramavhunga's justification of a R15-million bonus paid to him takes  him straight  to the moegoe scrapheap. He said he earned the bonus after his business, Dambale Holdings, facilitated a deal with Mvunonala Holdings, a company owned by  disgraced former VBS  chair Tshifhiwa Matodzi. The greed of these moegoe executives, at the expense of the poor, knows no bounds.

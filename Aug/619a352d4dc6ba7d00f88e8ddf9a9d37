The office of the senior public prosecutor in Palmridge, Joburg has subpoenaed Absa to release the details of the beneficiaries allegedly fraudulently debiting money from the account of Incredible Happenings Church leader Prophet Paseka "Mboro" Motsoeneng. This after the bank allegedly refused to give police officers details of the beneficiaries debiting money from his account without his authorisation. The letter, written by Palmridge senior public prosecutor Kenny Ramavhoya, reads as follows: "This serves to confirm that a fraud case has been registered with the Alberton police by the complainant, Mr Paseka Motsoeneng. The case is against Absa and relates to several unlawful debits off [sic] Mr Motsoeneng's account totalling over a million rand. We have since given the police 205 subpoenas to get the details of beneficiaries of these debits so we can institute prosecutions." National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) South Gauteng spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwane confirmed they have subpoenaed the banking group.

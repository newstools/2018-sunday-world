The Hawks are reviving cases of fraud against Kaizer Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung and his business associates, Herbert Theledi and Marius Grib, after they allegedly submitted fake documents in their company Lefika's bid to design Mbombela Stadium. Sunday World can exclusively reveal a meeting was held at the offices of Hawks' Brigadier Zama Basi in Pretoria on June 20, where a decision to resuscitate the case was taken. Those who attended the meeting included Advocate Patrick Nkuna of the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit and investigating officer Warrant Officer Mashudu Mashamba. Nkuna guided the police in their investigation on the cases and also led the prosecution against Motaung and his business associates. He was almost removed from the case after complaining he had received conflicting instructions from the NPA about whether the case was supposed to have been heard in the Mpumalanga High Court or regional court.

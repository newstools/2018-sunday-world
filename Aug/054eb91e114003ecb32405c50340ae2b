Having swapped the beaches of Cape Town for the concrete jungle that is Gauteng, new Mamelodi Sundowns winger Lyle Lakay feels a bit like a fish out of water. But the versatile attacker is better settled now at Chloorkop after his move from Cape Town City last month. "I don't go out much since I arrived here. I just go to the mall and then back to my place," Lakay said. "Obviously Cape Town is where all my loved ones are, family and friends, but adapting to new environments is the life of a footballer." What Lakay misses the most is spending time with his fiancée, Danielle, whom he hopes will relocate to Gauteng. "I am a laid-back person. This side I am still getting used to life, but even when I was back in Cape Town I wasn't all over the place," he said. "Most of the time I used to relax with my fiancée and my son Luca [from a previous relationship]. I am still alone this side, but the plan is to bring my fiancée this side. "My son will come and visit during holidays because he stays with his mom." Lakay has always depended on a strong support system throughout his football career. From the time he left the Mother City as a teenager to join SuperSport United's youth academy in 2009, to his transfers to Bloem Celtic and City FC. The 26-year-old confesses that his father, Sean, does not let him off the hook easily when his performance dips. "I am a family-oriented person. They are very supportive and I know that they are behind me all the way. "I am close to my father. He calls me all the time after games to analyse my performance and so on. My grandfather passed away recently and it was tough but we managed to get through it together."

Self-proclaimed kwasa king Malo-A-Botsheba's fleet of 18 vehicles have been repossessed by the South African Taxi Development Finance after he allegedly failed to keep up with monthly instalments. Three minibus taxis and 15 bakkies were repossessed by the repo men at his house in Mohlabaneng, Bolobedu in Limpopo last Wednesday. Social media was abuzz last week with speculation that he had deliberately crashed some of the cars to avoid the repo men, but Malo denied this and said they were simply involved in accidents in Polokwane. Malo bought each vehicle for over R400000 and was paying between R10000 and R15000 per month for each. The artist, who is known for recording songs praising the ANC and its leaders, was over R1.4m in arrears when the vehicles were repossessed after defaulting for six months. The taxi boss used the taxis to ferry commuters from Bolobedu to Tzaneen. He used the bakkies, which were fitted with sound systems and loud hailers, to campaign for the ANC. The fleet was taken to Johannesburg by the repo men where they will go under the hammer if he fails to pay the arrears within 30 days of the date of repossession. Sunday World has since learnt that a Gauteng businessman and ANC heavyweight donated R300000 to the muso on Tuesday to try and save the vehicles, but the institution rejected the amount and said it would only release them after he had settled the rest of the debt. Malo, real name Mokwalakwa Stephen Sefofa, confirmed that his vehicles have been repossessed. "They repossessed the cars and rejected the R300000 the Good Samaritan gave me to save them," he said. The organisation's lawyer, Renate Garlipp of Marie-Lou Bester Incorporated, stated in the letter sent to the musician's lawyer that they applied for default judgment after their plea for him to settle his arrears fell on deaf ears. Yolanda Niemand of SA Taxi Development Finance declined to comment.

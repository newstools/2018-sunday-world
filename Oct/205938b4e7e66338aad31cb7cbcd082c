French Montana features his collaborator Drake, along with cameos from A$AP Rocky, Young Thug and many more, in his new video for No Stylist. The rapper released his highly anticipated Drake-featuring track No Stylist last month and has now followed that up with a clip that is set in his hometown of the Bronx. French Montana is seen at several lavish locations and is joined by Drake backstage at a fashion show over the course of the clip, in which we see cameos from a number of famous faces, including Slick Rick, A$AP Rocky, Cam'ron, Young Thug, Luka Sabbat of Grown-ish and fashion icon Dapper Dan.

Nkosi made the announcement on Instagram on Friday by sharing the cutest picture of her little family. The proud mama also revealed that their little girl's name is Namisa "Nami" Dlamini. "I love this girl with a love I can't even begin to describe. I'm so blessed, I'm so in love. It's been a month of pure bliss," she said.

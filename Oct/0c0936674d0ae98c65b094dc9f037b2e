In this week's episode of Ba Kae? Shwa spotted former Isidingo actor Tshepo Maseko. Tjo! The crush I used to have on Parsons Matabane bathong! Aside from chopping off his dreadlocks not much has changed. He can still get it in the middle of the day shem. He is pushing that uncle bae kinda vibe. Yaaaass Dzaddy!

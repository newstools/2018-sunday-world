Many are asking how did Sars IT and digital chief officer Mmamathe Makhekhe-Mokhuane get this lucrative job, paying over R3m a year, if she can't even express herself? The moegoe acted like a real moron both during an SABC TV interview and her appearance before the Nugent Inquiry into the operations at the revenue service. The moegoe deserves a big boot to send her   sky-high, followed by a hard fall.

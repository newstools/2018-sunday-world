Congratulations to Team South Africa for flying the Mzansi flag high at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia. Their record-breaking performances are inspiring. With more than 40 medals already in the bag and counting, the team has made the country proud, lifting the spirits amid the mourning for one of the most revered Struggle icons, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Take a bow, charmzas.

Gather around millennials‚ Ntsiki Mazwai has some wise words to share. Okay wait. For those of you who don't know Mazwai‚ she is a poet and an activist‚ and she isn't shy to voice her opinions. As the mourners gathered at Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg to pay tribute to Winnie Madikizela-Madela‚ Ntsiki could not bite her tongue about how Ma Winnie's great grandchildren spoke in English and had a distinct twang. Mazwai also slammed parents who think that their children only speaking English is cute. Do you think Ntsiki has a point or does it even matter?

Nambitha Mpumlwana has been in the industry for a while and has constantly had to fight off the idea that she is a diva‚ explaining that she is simply honouring and looking after herself. Speaking on Trending SA this week‚ Ma said that she was "raised by a diva" and explained that a diva meant someone "who knew her personal space. Knew her stillness. Knew her needs and if she needed to communicate that to you‚ she would do that." The veteran actress has made the label her own‚ opening a business called Diva Nexis to help girls learn to love themselves. "I think that a lot of people misunderstand what self-love is about. Because it is labelled diva‚ let's call it that but own it and love it. If I can bring the diva out of you and help you celebrate yourself on a daily basis‚ then that is what it is about. It is about honouring yourself‚" she explained. Here's just three tips she has for being the perfect diva: Mpumlwana was one of the famous Generations 16 fired over salary disputes back in 2014 and she has since gone on to star in other TV shows. Speaking during an interview with Move magazine shortly after getting a new gig on Ashes to Ashes‚ Mpumlwana admitted that she's a perfectionist that sometimes come across being dramatic. "I am one of only a handful of actors in this country who are not just talented‚ but have taken the trouble to learn the best ways of making any role they are cast in as real as it can be for the viewers‚" she explained.

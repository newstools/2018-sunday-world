Trudi Makhaya takes our charmza honours hands down after President Cyril Ramaphosa  appointed her his economic adviser. Makhaya is  a former deputy commissioner at the Competition Commission. A proponent of African capitalism, she wrote: "For too long, capitalism in Africa has been dictated from the outside. It is time for African countries to shape this system for their own ends." Go for it, charmza.

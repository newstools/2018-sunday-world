President Cyril Ramaphosa's entrepreneur son Tumelo has degenerated to hallows of moegoeland overnight after likening  Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane to a "fool" and "monkey" on social media. Tumelo took a swipe at Duduzane  during his Dubai business trip this week. The moegoe was attending a blockchain economic gathering.  Stop shaming your dad, moegoe.

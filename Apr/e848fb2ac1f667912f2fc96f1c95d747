The racist morons opposed to integration at public schools in the country are moegoes deserving of a  lynching. The cowardly white right-wingers, pictured,  hanged an effigy of  Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi  on   a tree in public view this week   for his  opposition to Afrikaans-medium schools discriminating against English-speaking  pupils -  in effect excluding black learners from such schools.

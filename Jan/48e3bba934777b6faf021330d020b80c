The annual Sun Met took place on Saturday afternoon at the Kenilworth Racecourse, in Cape Town. While all eyes were on retired Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt's special appearance at the event, local stars didn’t disappoint with their Afro-centric sartorial choices. This year fashion theme was ‘Style ahead of the Field', which urged attendees to show off vibrant colours as well as eclectic prints and textures inspired by Africa.

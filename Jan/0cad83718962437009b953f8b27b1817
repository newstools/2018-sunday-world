Joyous Celebration singer Lynnzay Baatjies is singing the blues after she was arrested for allegedly stealing underwear. The songstress was arrested at Woolworths in Rosebank, Joburg, after she was allegedly caught in possession of goods she did not pay for on December 8. She was detained at the Rosebank police station and was later released on R500 bail, helping her to be on time for the music group's live DVD recording that took place the following day. Baatjies appeared in the Hillbrow Magistrate's Court this week where she pleaded not guilty. She asked for the matter to be postponed because her lawyer was not able to make it to court with her.

South Africa has had an abundance of moegoes this week, it's not funny. But most irritating is that the moegoes believe they are taking  us for a ride - as they  lie to us with straight faces at one of the tribunals or the other. If it was not Anoj Singh, it was Matshela Koko, Qedani Mahlangu or Bathabile Dlamini - the list is annoyingly endless. Damn moegoes.
